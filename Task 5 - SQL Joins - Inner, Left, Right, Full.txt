âœ… Sample Tables
ðŸ”¹ Table: Customers
customer_id	customer_name
1		John
2		Priya
3		Ahmed
4		Rita
ðŸ”¹ Table: Orders
order_id	customer_id	amount
101		1		500
102		2		300
103		1		200
104		5		400

âš  Note: customer_id = 5 in Orders does not exist in Customers.

âœ… 1. INNER JOIN â€“ Only Matching Records
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

âœ… Output:
customer_name	order_id	amount
John	101	500
Priya	102	300
John	103	200

âœ” Only customers who actually placed valid orders.

âœ… 2. LEFT JOIN â€“ All Customers + Their Orders (if any)
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

âœ… Output:
customer_name	order_id	amount
John	101	500
Priya	102	300
John	103	200
Ahmed	NULL	NULL
Rita	NULL	NULL

âœ” Shows customers even if they havenâ€™t made any orders.

âœ… 3. RIGHT JOIN â€“ All Orders + Matching Customers
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customers c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

âœ… Output:
customer_name	order_id	amount
John	101	500
Priya	102	300
John	103	200
NULL	104	400

âœ” Includes orders even if the customer doesn't exist in the customers table.

âœ… 4. FULL OUTER JOIN â€“ All Data from Both Tables

(Use UNION for MySQL)

SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id

UNION

SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM Customers c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

âœ… Output:
customer_name	order_id	amount
John	101	500
Priya	102	300
John	103	200
Ahmed	NULL	NULL
Rita	NULL	NULL
NULL	104	400

âœ” All customers + all orders, matched or not.
